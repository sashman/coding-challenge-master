## Your Design Decisions

We'd love to hear your thoughts around any design decisions you made while coding your solution.

## My Solution

### OOP

The "elephant in the room" of solution, you might notice, is that I have not used an object oriented approach. And I under stand that I can convert some my modules, e.g. CurrencyExchangeRates into a class, however I have made a conscious decision not to. To justify this I would like to put forward my personal preferece of funtional programming apporach. In my opinion some mechanisms gain complexity, which can potentially grow to be harmful, from use of OOP. Considering the solution requirements, implementing a pure function with no side effects and clear inputs and output, I believe, functional approach is well suited here.

### Test driven approach

I have used TDD, or a close, more pragmatic approximation of it, to achieve goal. The implementation of the validation lend itself very well to this. The tests for validating the input were missing so I thought the first step would be to add them, and then follow up with the implementation.
